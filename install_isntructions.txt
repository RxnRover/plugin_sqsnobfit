Setting up SQSnobFit Optimizer
------------------------------
Inside <documents>/Plugins/Optimizers/SQSnobFit there are two folders, plugin, where the Rxn Rover plugin resides, and sqsnobfit_remote_optimizer, where the necessary code to launch an instance of SQSnobFit that can communicate with the plugin. If you are using Linux or Mac, simply type make install in the sqsnobfit_remote_optimizer directory to download and install dependencies into a virtual environment.

If using Windows, open a terminal in the sqsnobfit_remote_optimizer directory and type the following commands:


python -m venv venv             # Creates a virtual environment (venv)
.\venv\Scripts\activate         # Activates the venv
pip install -r requirements.txt # Installs dependencies in venv
deactivate                      # Deactivates the venv


Configurations
--------------
The SQSnobFit optimization can be configured by editing or creating a new config file in the sqsnobfit_remote_optimizer/config directory. An example configuration file with default values is provided as default-config.json.

Plugin Scripts
Scripts used by the plugin are located in the sqsnobfit_remote_optimizer/scripts subdirectory. When creating a new script, ensure that it activates the venv, runs src/main.py with the correct config file as a command line argument, and deactivates the venv when complete. An example start script file should be present in the scripts directory.
